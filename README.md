Success History Adaptive Competitive Swarm Optimizer with Linear Population Reduction: Performance Benchmarking and Application in Eye Disease Detection  
Necessary packages: opfunu, enoppy, and Pytorch  

# Highlights  
• We equip Success History Adaptation and Linear Population Reduction to CSO and develop L-SHACSO.  
• Comprehensive numerical experiments in CEC benchmarks and engineering problems confirm the competitiveness of L-SHACSO.  
• The sensitivity experiments are conducted to demonstrate the robustness of L-SHACSO.  
• We further integrate L-SHACSO into DenseNet and ELM to propose DenseNet-L-SHACSO-ELM for eye disease detection.
